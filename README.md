# northwind-mysql-queries
A collection of sample queries I wrote for the Northwind database using MySQL. Query prompts come from [geeksengine.com](https://www.geeksengine.com/database/problem-solving/northwind-queries-part-1.php).
<br><br>
I'm in the process of reworking the database to use world regions. The changes to the database itself can be found here: https://github.com/andrew-lundy/northwind_mysql. The repo holds the queries needed to create the tables and insert the data.
<br><br>
The queries making those changes are found in the commits of the [repo you are currently viewing](https://github.com/andrew-lundy/northwind-mysql-queries/commits/dev).
<br><br>

**The purpose** of this project is to get hands-on with MySQL and work with an existing database. To do this, I've laid out some milestones:<br>
[ ] Update the regions used in the database to use the four main regions of the world (EMEA, NA, LATAM, APAC)<br>
    [ ] Tables to Update<br>
        [ ] Territories<br>
        [ ] Employees<br>
        [ ] Orders<br>
        [ ] Customers<br>
        [ ] Region<br>
        [ ] Suppliers<br>
