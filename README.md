# northwind-mysql-queries
A collection of sample queries I wrote for the Northwind database using MySQL. Query prompts come from [geeksengine.com](https://www.geeksengine.com/database/problem-solving/northwind-queries-part-1.php). <br><br>
I'm in the process of reworking the database to use world regions. The changes to the database itself can be found here: https://github.com/andrew-lundy/northwind_mysql. The queries making those changes are found in the commits of the repo you are currently viewing.
